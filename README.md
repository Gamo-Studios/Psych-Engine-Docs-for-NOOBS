# Psych-Engine-Docs-for-NOOBS
A complete psych engine tutorial doc for people to make fnf mods!!!

WARNING: This is a work in progress documentation. The docs will be completed soon, so, stay tuned!!! :)

NOTE: The actual stuffs are on the wiki section. **BUT FIRST, YOU SHOULD READ THIS, THIS HAS A SECRET PASSWORD FOR SOMETHING..? (jk, but read it!!!)** 

# Introductions first!!!
**FROM ME!**
Heya. I'm Mr.StiK, the one and only owner of GAMO-STUDIOS!

My main hobby is to make stuff, like, game dev, art, music, comics, mods, and so on.

And since I like to talk on those stuff, I'll make a lot of 'records' on it, like, twitter, youtube, and so on.

I'm learning psych engine (also modding, go check out MY MOD: https://gamebanana.com/wips/66785), and I took the hard way, honest.

I thought, "Why people just find answers but does not usually tell this on others? WHY?  W H Y?"

So, I got fed uo on this chain and started this Doc. Hopefully, this will give you a great guide to psych engine.

**MODDING...?**
If you're like "WHAT'S BASICALLY MODDING?", I've to ask you 1 thing; THEN WHY THE FRICKING HECK YOU SEARCHED FOR **THIS?**

Ok, so, just a reminder, I guess. Modding means basically, you just edit the original game's file and do something custom, like custom skin, custom music, custom player, even custom CODE!!! Now, code is just piece of cake in psych engine, so, don't worry on THAT!

**Friday Night Funkin'**
Friday Night Funkin' (often abbreviated to FNF) is an open-source[2] donationware rhythm game first released in 2020 for a game jam.[3] The game was developed by a team of four Newgrounds users, Cameron "Ninjamuffin99" Taylor, David "PhantomArcade" Brown, Isaac "Kawai Sprite" Garcia, and evilsk8r. The game shares some gameplay features with Dance Dance Revolution and PaRappa the Rapper and borrows aesthetic influences from Flash games.[4] The game has been credited with driving users back to Newgrounds, a site whose popularity peaked in the early 2000s.

**Psych Enigne**
Get me straight; Psych Engine is **not** only the option for FNF modding. There are other stuff like Kade Engine, Yoshi Engine, and even the original files ( GET 'EM HERE!!!https://github.com/ninjamuffin99/Funkin) But Psych Engine has bit more functions and stuff, and it's easy to use!

So, yeah. you know what I mean

So, I guess these are what I want to talk to you before starting.

Thanks for reading till here
